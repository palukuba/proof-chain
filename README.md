# 🎓 ProofChain

> **ProofChain secures academic credentials on the Cardano blockchain.** Schools issue tamper-proof diplomas, students truly own their achievements, and employers verify them instantly. A decentralized solution for academic trust, eliminating fraud and streamlining verification.

## 🚀 What it Does
**ProofChain** is a decentralized platform that allows educational institutions to issue academic credentials (diplomas, transcripts, certificates) as immutable assets on the **Cardano blockchain**.

- **For Schools**: A seamless dashboard to manage students and issue tamper-proof credentials.
- **For Students**: A permanent digital wallet of their academic achievements that they truly own.
- **For Employers**: Instant verification of candidate credentials without intermediaries.

## 🛠️ How We Built It
We built ProofChain bridging the gap between robust Web2 UX and Web3 security:

- **Frontend**: Built with **React 19** and **Vite** for a lightning-fast, responsive user experience.
- **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS** for a modern, clean, and accessible interface.
- **Backend & Auth**: **Supabase** provides secure authentication, real-time database capabilities, and Row Level Security (RLS) to ensure data privacy.
- **Blockchain (In Progress)**: Integration with **Cardano** for minting credentials as native assets/NFTs, ensuring longevity and immutability.
- **Storage**: **IPFS** for decentralized storage of credential metadata and document files.

## 🏆 Hackathon Journey
Building ProofChain was a challenge in balancing user experience with decentralization. We focused heavily on making the onboarding process for traditional institutions as familiar as possible (using email/password auth via Supabase) while preparing the architecture for blockchain integration.

## 🔮 What's Next for ProofChain
- **Mainnet Launch**: Moving from Cardano Preprod to Mainnet.
- **Verifiable Credentials (DID)**: Implementing Atala PRISM or similar standards for self-sovereign identity.
- **Institution Verification**: A governance model to verify legitimate educational institutions.
